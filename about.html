        <p>"Build-a-Bag" was created to provide a virtual, interactive way to donate to ONETrack International.
        Users drag the items into the backpack, and the corresponding donation amount will be added to the cart.
        Upon clicking "Checkout (Chuffed)", the user will be directed to a Chuffed campaign I set up that is linked
        to ONETrack's payment systems. The money will then be given to communities in need of educational funding
        around the world. ONETrack's minimal overhead costs ensure these donations go directly to children in need.</p>
